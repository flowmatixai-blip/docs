## **What are API's in Flowmatix?**

The **API Section in Flowmatix** allows you to connect your chatbot with external services, fetch real-time data, and send dynamic information to users during a conversation. Instead of relying only on static messages, you can integrate APIs to fetch product details, check order status, or push data to your CRM directly from the chatbot flow.

This enables your chatbot to become more intelligent, versatile, and personalized, thereby improving user engagement and automating tasks seamlessly.

## **Benefits of using APIs in Flowmatix**

- **Enable dynamic conversations** by fetching real-time data from external systems.
- **Improve personalization** by mapping API responses to user attributes.
- **Automate workflows** by sending and receiving data without manual intervention.
- **Increase reliability** with error handling and fallback messages when APIs fail.

## **Setting up API's in Flowmatix**

1. Login to your **Flowmatix Dashboard**
2. Go to the **Developer Section** from the sidebar.


1. Click on **“Create API”** to add a new API.


1. To create an API, enter the following details:
   1. Enter a **Name** for your API (e.g., _Products API_).
   2. Paste the **API URL** you want to use.


1. Click **Test** to see the API response. The response will appear in the **Response Section**.
